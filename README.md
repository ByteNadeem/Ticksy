### Basic Description

The database has three tables:

- **User**: Stores user account information (uses Django's built-in User model)
- **Category**: Stores task categories (like "Work", "Personal", etc.)
- **Task**: Stores individual tasks with title, due date, and completion status

### Relationships

- Each user can have many tasks (One-to-Many)
- Each category can have many tasks (One-to-Many)
- Each task belongs to one user and one category

This simple structure allows users to organize their tasks by category and track completion status.
