A task management application built with Django.

## ðŸ“Š Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The Ticksy system has three main entities: User, Category, and Task.

### Basic Description

The database has three tables:

- **User**: Stores user account information (uses Django's built-in User model)
- **Category**: Stores task categories (like "Work", "Personal", etc.)
- **Task**: Stores individual tasks with title, due date, and completion status

### Relationships

- Each user can have many tasks (One-to-Many)
- Each category can have many tasks (One-to-Many)
- Each task belongs to one user and one category

This simple structure allows users to organize their tasks by category and track completion status.

### Automated Testing
This project includes a suite of automated tests to help ensure everything works as expected. The tests cover the most important features of the Ticksy app:

#### Form Validation:
We check that tasks can be created with valid data and that the form correctly rejects missing or invalid information.

#### Model Logic:
The tests confirm that tasks and categories are saved and displayed properly, and that default values (like task completion status) work as intended.

#### View and Permission Checks:
The appâ€™s main views are tested to make sure only logged-in users can access or modify their own tasks. We also verify that users canâ€™t change or delete tasks that belong to someone else.

#### CRUD Operations: 
Creating, updating, and deleting tasks are all tested to ensure these core features work smoothly.

To run the tests, simply use: python manage.py test This will automatically check all forms, models, and views for correct behavior.
